## 🎯 Philosophy

### **Designed for Enterprise**

Every icon in this library has been **meticulously crafted** to meet the demanding requirements of enterprise software applications. From subtle interface elements to bold call-to-action buttons, each variant serves a specific purpose in professional user interfaces.

<br />

### **Performance by Design**

Built from the ground up with **tree-shaking optimization** and **minimal runtime overhead**. Only import what you use, ensuring your applications remain fast and lightweight regardless of the icon library's size.

<br />

### **Consistency at Scale**

**Four carefully balanced variants** (light, regular, bold, filled) ensure visual harmony across your entire application ecosystem. Whether you're building dashboards, mobile apps, or complex web platforms, maintain consistent visual language.
